# Loan Default Risk Analysis and Prediction

**Project Overview**
Loan default risk prediction is critical for banks, lenders, and credit agencies. Instead of passively reacting to insolvency losses, financial institutions can proactively identify customers who are likely to default and take preventive measures.

This project analyzes customer profiling based on financial and demographic attributes (such as income, occupation, and marriage status) and applies machine learning models to predict loan default risk.
