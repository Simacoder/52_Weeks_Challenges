    "When searching for a value in a dataset, your goal is to find its index, or location, so you can easily retrieve and use that value in your code. Several search algorithms can help you locate the index of a specific value. One of the most efficient and fundamental methods is binary search.  "

    "Binary search is a powerful algorithm designed to efficiently find a value in a sorted dataset. The core idea behind binary search is straightforward: Instead of checking each element in the dataset one by one, like in a linear search, binary search narrows down the search range by half with each step, making the process much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by comparing the target value with the middle element of the dataset. The index for the middle value is calculated using the formula: middle = (low + high) / 2, where low is the index of the first element in the current search range, and high is the index of the last element.\n",
    "Compare the middle value with the target. If the target value is equal to the middle element, you've found the index, and the search is complete. If the target value is smaller than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the dataset. If the target value is larger, the search continues in the right half of the dataset.\n",
    "Repeat steps 1-2. The search range is continually halved at each step. Repeat the process until the target value is found or the search range becomes empty."

While linear search has a time complexity of O(n), meaning it may have to check every single element in the worst case, binary search is more efficient. It has a time complexity of O(log n), meaning the search space is halved with each step, significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed."
