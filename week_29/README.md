# Guide to Causal Structure Learning with Bayesian Methods in Python

# 📖 Overview

This project provides a practical guide to causal structure learning using Bayesian methods in Python. It explains why correlation does not imply causation, and walks through how to build causal models from data using Bayesian networks and structure learning techniques.

Whether you're a data scientist, statistician, or researcher, this guide introduces key concepts and hands-on approaches for uncovering causal relationships in complex systems.

# 🧠 Key Concepts
- **Correlation vs. Causation**: Not all associations indicate cause-effect relationships. This guide explores how to move beyond correlation using structured probabilistic reasoning.

- **Causal Graphs (DAGs)**: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) represent causal dependencies among variables and serve as the foundation of Bayesian networks.

- **Structure Learning**: Techniques to infer the DAG from observational (and optionally interventional) data.

# 🔍 Why Bayesian Methods?

Bayesian approaches offer a flexible and powerful framework for causal structure learning:

- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Returns full posterior distributions over graphs, not just a single best estimate.

- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate prior knowledge and reason with incomplete or missing data using Bayes’ rule.

- **Modularity**: Causal models are composable—complex systems can be built by connecting simpler submodels.

- **Graph-Theoretic Intuition**: Natural way to represent highly interacting variables using graphs.

- **Probabilistic Coherence**: Probability theory ensures consistent reasoning under uncertainty.

# ⚠️ Limitations

While Bayesian networks are powerful, they come with computational challenges:

- **Search Complexity**: Finding the optimal DAG requires exploring a combinatorially large space of possible structures.

- **Scalability**: Exhaustive search becomes infeasible with more than ~15 nodes (depending on the number of variable states).
