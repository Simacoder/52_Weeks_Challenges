# Week 6: Electricity Theft Detection  

This is Week 6 of the **52 Weeks, 52 Projects** challenge! 🚀  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This week, we focused on developing an **Electricity Theft Detection** system to identify fraudulent electricity usage using machine learning techniques. The project analyzes power consumption patterns to detect anomalies and potential cases of theft.  

## 🔗 Links  
- **GitHub Repository**: [Electricity Theft Detection](https://github.com/Simacoder/eletricity_theft_detection)  
- **Live Demo**: [Streamlit App](https://eletricitytheftdetection-jtvuaji3roxrqjuxvl7amw.streamlit.app/)  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Data-driven electricity theft detection  
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection  
- Interactive visualization through Streamlit  

## 📌 How to Use  
1. Visit the **Live Demo** link to interact with the model.  
2. Upload or select a dataset to analyze electricity usage patterns.  
3. View predictions on potential electricity theft cases.  

Stay tuned for next week's project! 🚀
