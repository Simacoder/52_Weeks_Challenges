# 52 WEEKS OF 52 PROJECTS:

# Project 52

The Project 52 is a personal challenge according to which I should make one project every week, for 52 weeks (one year). It doesn't state what kind of project should I make or anything else related to that. But I have a long list of technologies I'd like to try and test, so I probably will have a lot to do.

52 weeks of code is where every week for 52 weeks you make a code-based project. They can be small - medium-sized projects, websites, extensions, apps, games, etc. Anything that lets you be creative and get your ideas out / practice your programming skills.
